# Lean Language Evaluation Function

This repository contains the boilerplate code needed to create a containerized evaluation function written in Lean 4 Language.

## Quickstart

This chapter helps you to quickly creating a new Lean 4 evaluation function using this template repository.

> [!NOTE]
> After setting up the evaluation function, delete this chapter from the `README.md` file, and add your own documentation.

#### 1. Create a new repository

- In GitHub, choose `Use this template` > `Create a new repository` in the repository toolbar.

- Choose the owner, and pick a name for the new repository.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > If you want to deploy the evaluation function to Lambda Feedback, make sure to choose the Lambda Feedback organization as the owner.

- Set the visibility to `Public` or `Private`.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > If you want to use GitHub [deployment protection rules](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#deployment-protection-rules), make sure to set the visibility to `Public`.

- Click on `Create repository`.

#### 2. Clone the new repository

Clone the new repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

#### 3. Configure the evaluation function

When deploying to Lambda Feedback, set the evaluation function name in the `config.json` file. Read the [Deploy to Lambda Feedback](#deploy-to-lambda-feedback) section for more information.

#### 4. Develop the evaluation function

You're ready to start developing your evaluation function. Head over to the [Development](#development) section to learn more.

#### 5. Update the README

In the `README.md` file, change the title and description so it fits the purpose of your evaluation function.

Also, don't forget to delete the Quickstart chapter from the `README.md` file after you've completed these steps.

## Usage

You can run the evaluation function either using [the pre-built Docker image](#run-the-docker-image) or build and run [the binary executable](#build-and-run-the-binary).

### Run the Docker Image

The pre-built Docker image comes with [Shimmy](https://github.com/lambda-feedback/shimmy) installed.

> [!TIP]
> Shimmy is a small application that listens for incoming HTTP requests, validates the incoming data and forwards it to the underlying evaluation function. Learn more about Shimmy in the [Documentation](https://github.com/lambda-feedback/shimmy).

The pre-built Docker image is available on the GitHub Container Registry. You can run the image using the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/lambda-feedback/my-lean-evaluation-function:latest
```

### Build and Run the Binary

To run the evaluation function, you need to build the binary first. See the [Building the Evaluation Function](#building-the-evaluation-function) section for more information.

After the function has been built, you can choose between running the function itself, ore using Shimmy to run the function.

**Raw Mode**

Use the following command to run the evaluation function directly:

```bash
.lake/build/bin/evaluation request.json response.json
```

This will run the evaluation function using the input data from `request.json` and write the output to `response.json`.

**Shimmy**

To have a more user-friendly experience, you can use [Shimmy](https://github.com/lambda-feedback/shimmy) to run the evaluation function.

To run the evaluation function using Shimmy, use the following command:

```bash
shimmy -c ".lake/build/bin/evaluation" -i file
```

## Development

This chapter will guide you through the development process of the evaluation function.

### Prerequisites

In order to develop, test and build the evaluation function, you need to have the following tools installed:

- [Lean 4](https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/quickstart.html)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

> The lean toolchain will automatically install the right version of Lean 4 for you as soon as you're working on the evaluation function. You can find the toolchain version in the `lean-toolchain` file.

### Repository Structure

```bash
.github/workflows/
    build.yml       # builds the public evaluation function image
    deploy.yml      # deploys the evaluation function to Lambda Feedback

src/                # evaluation function source code
    Evaluation.lean # module containing the evaluation function
    Main.lean       # module containing the `main` function used to build the executable

tests/              # testing code
    Main.lean       # module containing tests and `main` function run by `lake test`

util/               # utility source code
    Testing.lean    # module containing utility for running tests

config.json         # evaluation function deployment configuration file
lakefile.lean       # Lake build configuration
lean-toolchain      # Lean toolchain version configuration
```

### Building the Evaluation Function

To build the evaluation function, run the following command:

```bash
lake build
```

This will build a binary executable using the default of the evaluation function, which is configured in `lakefile.lean`.

The executable can be found in `.lake/build/bin/`.

### Running Tests

To run the tests, run the following command:

```bash
lake test
```

This will use the lake test executor to run the module declared as test runner in `lakefile.lean`. You can find the test module in `tests/Main.lean`.

### Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image, run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t my-lean-evaluation-function .
```

The Dockerfile accepts the following build arguments:

- `LEAN_VERSION`: _(optional)_ the version of Lean 4 to use.

## Deployment

This section guides you through the deployment process of the evaluation function. If you want to deploy the evaluation function to Lambda Feedback, follow the steps in the [Lambda Feedback](#deploy-to-lambda-feedback) section. Otherwise, you can deploy the evaluation function to other platforms using the [Other Platforms](#deploy-to-other-platforms) section.

### Deploy to Lambda Feedback

Deploying the evaluation function to Lambda Feedback is simple and straightforward, as long as the repository is within the [Lambda Feedback organization](https://github.com/lambda-feedback).

After configuring the repository, a [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) will automatically build and deploy the evaluation function to Lambda Feedback as soon as changes are pushed to the main branch of the repository.

**Configuration**

The deployment configuration is stored in the `config.json` file. Choose a unique name for the evaluation function and set the `EvaluationFunctionName` field in [`config.json`](config.json).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The evaluation function name must be unique within the Lambda Feedback organization, and must be in `lowerCamelCase`. You can find a example configuration below:

```json
{
  "EvaluationFunctionName": "compareStringsWithLean"
}
```

### Deploy to other Platforms

If you want to deploy the evaluation function to other platforms, you can use the Docker image to deploy the evaluation function.

Please refer to the deployment documentation of the platform you want to deploy the evaluation function to.

If you need help with the deployment, feel free to reach out to the Lambda Feedback team by creating an issue in the template repository.
